# Lab report 1 Week 2 

### How to remotely connect to a course specific account on ieng6 (For MacOS)


#### **Part 1**: 
The first thing to do is to download [VSCode](https://code. visualstudio.com/download) or install an IDE with a terminal

* After downloading it, open it and it should look something like this:

There is a built in terminal in VScode, which can be opened by going to terminal -> new terminal. This will be used in order to remotely access the ieng6 server. 

#### **Part 2**: 
After installing the IDE, Lookup your ieng6 account [here.](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) You may need to update your password so you can access the server. Go to the terminal and type in the command 'ssh cs15lsp22xxx@ieng6.ucsd.edu where xxx is a unique to you. There will be a password prompt where you enter your password.

Note: there is no password prompt because there is an ssh key that automatically allows access (this will be covered later).
